 ## Usage

 When the application is started. You are presented with a home page which has a button to get started with send you to the notes page when clicked. When you are at the notes page. Once you can enter a new title and a note, a save button shows up next to the clear form button allowing you to save your note. Once the save buttom is click. The new note saves and appears in the left column with other existing notes and the buttons. When you select an existing note in the list, the saved information displays and a new note button appears at the top right corner. To delete a note, just click on the icon in the notes list.

 Everything was accomplished by using Express.js.  Below are a few code snippet connecting the back end to the front end with routes.

 A Get Route:

    app.get("/notes", (req, res) => {res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "public/notes.html"))
    })


A Post Route:

    app.post("/api/notes", (req, res) => {
        --code omitted--
    });

Delete Route:

    app.delete("/api/notes/:id", (req, res) => {
            --code omitted--
        });

PORT listner:

    app.listen(PORT, function () {console.log(`Listening to http://localhost:${PORT}`)});


Unique ID generater used to add IDs to notes:

    const uuid = () => {
    return Math.floor((1 + Math.random()) * 0x10000)
    .toString(16)
    .substring(1);
    };
